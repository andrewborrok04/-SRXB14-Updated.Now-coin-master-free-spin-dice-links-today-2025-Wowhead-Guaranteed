Why Isn't My Coin Master Link Working?
If your Coin Master link isn't working, it's likely because of one of the two following reasons:

You've already redeemed that Coin Master spins link
The Coin Master spins link is expired
You can tell if you've already claimed an active Coin Master link if you click on it and you get a pop-up that reads "Sorry. You alredy received the gift from this link." If you haven't claimed a link and the message appears, try force-closing the app and opening it again.

Coin Master links expire often and are usually only redeemable for two to three days before expiring. So if you've clicked on a link and it doesn't work, even after restarting your game, it's probably expired. You can tell if it's expired if you get a message that reads "Sorry. This offer has ended. Try again next time."
